------------

**Where?** [Live demo](http://example.com/)

**What?** The main purpose of this project is to allow exploration of how population density of swedish munincipalities correlates with the locations of fifteen different places, such as hospitals and power plants.

**Why?** I just really wanted to create something using maps, and this project was one of the ideas I had. Additionally, it allowed me to better understand the options for web-based map solutions -- before this project, the only option I was aware of was Google Maps.

**How?** Other than plain JavaScript, the project was mainly built with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).

**Main difficulty?** Definitely finding, collecting, and wrangling all the location data. For instance, OSM data was harder than expected to download.
