# Locations x Population density

**Where?** [Live demo](https://dd-placesmap.netlify.app/)

**What?** A map showing how population density of swedish munincipalities correlates with the locations of fifteen different places, such as hospitals and power plants.

**Why?** I like maps, and population density was one of the ideas I had for exploring and better understanding the options that are available for creating web-based map solutions. Before this project, the only option I was aware of was Google Maps.

**How?** Built with JavaScript and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).

**Main difficulty?** Definitely finding, collecting, and wrangling all the location data. They all come from different sources, with most being quite cumbersome to deal with.
